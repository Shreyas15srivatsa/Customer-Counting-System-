# Customer Counting System - An Embedded System Project

## About
- Developed an embedded system powered by a Raspberry Pi that keeps track of
the number of people entering and exiting a room using laser and photo diodes.
- Implemented state-machines to read the config files and track laser breaking
sequences.
- The system runs on a watchdog timer to reboot the Pi in the event of any
unexpected errors. 
- In addition, the data is written to log files for further analysis.
